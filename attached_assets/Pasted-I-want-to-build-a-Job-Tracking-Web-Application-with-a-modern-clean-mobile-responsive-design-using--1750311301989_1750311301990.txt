I want to build a Job Tracking Web Application with a modern, clean, mobile-responsive design using React and Tailwind CSS (or similar). The website should include a dashboard to track job applications, a form to add jobs, options to edit/update entries, upload resumes, and basic reminder functionality including Google Calendar support.

Features and Structure:

1. Main Dashboard Page:
- Display all job applications as cards or a table.
- Each entry should show:
  - Company Name
  - Job Role
  - Date Applied
  - Source (LinkedIn, Naukri, Company Website, Google Jobs, Others)
  - Application Status (Applied / Rejected / Interview Scheduled / Offered)
  - Notes
  - Resume File Uploaded (show file name with a download button)

2. Job Application Form Page:
- Form Fields:
  - Company Name (text)
  - Job Role (text)
  - Date Applied (date picker)
  - Source (dropdown: LinkedIn, Naukri, Company Website, Google Jobs, Others)
    - If "Others" is selected, show a custom input field for manual entry
  - Resume Upload (PDF only)
    - The uploaded resume should be downloadable later from the dashboard
  - Notes (textarea)
  - Status (dropdown: Applied, Interview Scheduled, Rejected, Offered)
    - If "Interview Scheduled" is selected:
      - Input field to specify the interview round (e.g., TR, HR, MR, Coding, etc.)
      - Date/Time input for expected result announcement
      - The result date should simulate a reminder, and also provide the option to add it to Google Calendar

3. Edit Application Option:
- Ability to edit any existing application (update status, change resume, notes, source, etc.)

4. Status Filter:
- Buttons or dropdown to filter job applications by status:
  - All
  - Applied
  - Interview Scheduled
  - Rejected
  - Offered

5. Design Requirements:
- Clean UI using Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI
- Mobile-friendly, responsive layout
- Use icons or color badges for each status
- After uploading a resume, show the file name and a download button
- Show the interview round and result date clearly

6. Reminder and Notification Logic:
- When a "Result Date" is provided, simulate a notification reminder
- Also provide an "Add to Google Calendar" button that allows adding the event directly to the userâ€™s Google Calendar with title, date, and description
